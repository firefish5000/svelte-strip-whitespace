1. Typedocs has failed us. Create proper docs by hand
3. Example output
4. REPL with live output preview (Easy to understand when combined with comment mode)
5. Tests
6. Source maps. 
   1. I already return them, but perhaps I should add it to markup myself as well since, IIRC svelte does not do that for us yet.
   2. Do I transform existing source maps or point to them?
