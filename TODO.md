1. Figure out typedoc
   1. Somethings seems to be caching old source code, I am assuming in typedoc. As it generates using old text, function names, and wording on a consistent basis. Very hard to generate new docs for new or reworded.
2. Create proper docs
3. Example output
4. REPL with live output preview (Easy to understand when combined with comment mode)
5. Tests
6. Source maps. 
   1. how? via appending sourcemap string?
   2. Do I transform existing source maps or point to them?
